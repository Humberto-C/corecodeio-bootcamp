# Wednesday Challenges 

1. **Learn about binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers**

## Binary Numbers 

Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.
Like this:

|   | 0 |  Start at zero |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • | 1 | Then 1 |
| •• | 10 | there is no "2" in binary, so start back at 0 ...... and add one to the number on the left |
| ••• | 11 |  |
| •••• | 100 | start back at 0 again, and add one to the number on the left... but that number is already at 1 so it also goes back to 0 ... and 1 is added to the next position on the left |
| ••••• | 101 |  |
| •••••• | 110 |  |
| ••••••• | 111 |  |
| •••••••• | 1000 | Start back at 0 again (for all 3 digits), add 1 on the left |
| ••••••••• | 1001 | And so on! |

## Decimal Numbers 

The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

But notice something interesting: there is no symbol for "ten". "10" is actually two symbols put together, a "1" and a "0":
