# Wednesday Challenges 

1. **Learn about binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers**

## Binary Numbers 

Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.
Like this:

|   | 0 |  Start at zero |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • | 1 | Then 1 |
| •• | 10 | there is no "2" in binary, so start back at 0 ...... and add one to the number on the left |
| ••• | 11 |  |
| •••• | 100 | start back at 0 again, and add one to the number on the left... but that number is already at 1 so it also goes back to 0 ... and 1 is added to the next position on the left |
| ••••• | 101 |  |
| •••••• | 110 |  |
| ••••••• | 111 |  |
| •••••••• | 1000 | Start back at 0 again (for all 3 digits), add 1 on the left |
| ••••••••• | 1001 | And so on! |

## Decimal Numbers 

The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

But notice something interesting: there is no symbol for "ten". "10" is actually two symbols put together, a "1" and a "0":

In decimal you count "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,..." but then you run out of symbols!

So you add 1 on the left and then start again at 0: 10.11,12, ...

Like this:

| | 0 | Start at 0 |
|---|---|---|
| • | 1 | Then 1 |
| •• | 2 | Then 2 |
| | ⋮	| |
| ••••••••• | 9 | Up to 9 |
| ••••••••••	| 10 | Start back at 0 again, but add 1 on the left |
| •••••••••••	| 11 | |
| ••••••••••••	| 12 | |
| | ⋮	| |
| ••••••••••••••••••• | 19 | |
| •••••••••••••••••••• | 20	| Start back at 0 again, but add 1 on the left |
| ••••••••••••••••••••• | 21 | And so on! |


## Hexadecimal Numbers

Hexadecimal numbers are interesting. There are 16 of them!

They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.

So a single Hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10 like this:

| **Decimal:** | 0 |	1 |	2 |	3 |	4 |	5 |	6 |	7 |	8 |	9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Hexadecimal:** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F |

And we count in Hexadecimal like this:

| | 0 | Start at 0 |
|-|-|-|
| • | 1 | Then 1 |
| •• | 2 | Then 2 |
| | ⋮	| |
| ••••••••••••••• |	F | Up to F |
| •••••••••••••••• | 10 | Start back at 0 again, but add 1 on the left |
| ••••••••••••••••• | 11 | |
| | ⋮	| |
| ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• | 1F | |
| •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• | 20 | Start back at 0 again, but add 1 on the left |
| ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• | 21 | And so on! |
