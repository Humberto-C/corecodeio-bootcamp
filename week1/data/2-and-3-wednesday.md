2. Translate the year you where born to binary, decimal and hexadecimal

Binary numbers are given in base 2 raised to "n", and we read them with the exponent "0" and increasing it by one from left to right, like this:

 | __ | 2<sup>0</sup> | 1 |
 |---|---|---|
 | __ __ | 2<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>0</sup> | 2 1 |
 
 So if we have ( 1 1 ) we can read this as 2<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>0</sup> = 2 + 1 and with the sum of those two ones we have as a result number "3",
 
 another example (1 0 1) we can read this as 2<sup>2</sup> ~~2<sup>1</sup>~~ 2<sup>0</sup> = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
 
 and one last time (1 0 1 0) we can read this as 2<sup>3</sup> ~~2<sup>2</sup>~~ 2<sup>1</sup> ~~2<sup>0</sup>~~ = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10
 
 I was born in 1994 then:
 
1024 512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 = 1994

Hexadecimal is quite similar, however, instead of base "2" we will have base "16" and we use extra symbols after number 9:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

16<sup>2</sup> 16<sup>1</sup> 16<sup>0</sup> = 256 16 1

if we have (7 4 1) = 7 x 256 + 4 x 16 + 1 = 1792 + 64 + 1 = 1857

(7 C A) = 7 x 256 + C(12) x 16 + A(10) x 1 = 1792 + 192 + 10 = 1994
